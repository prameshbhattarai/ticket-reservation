# ticket-reservation

1. Create a simple application that demonstrates the online ticket reservation system and can manage the records of reservation & payment.

- [x] a. User registration from the user interface is not required i.e. user can be inserted accessing the database.  
- [x] b. For authentication, use basic authentication or JWT OAuth (preferred).
- [x] c. You can assume that once a ticket reserved is neither modifiable nor removable.
- [x] d. Also, the same for payment, once made payment cannot be modified or removed. Payment & reservation should be related to each other.

2. There should be at least two pages for

- [x] a. Reserving the ticket & making the payment.
- [ ] b. Try to make a dashboard to show the daily metrics (e.g. total tickets reserved, total payment, etc.).
- [ ] c. Consider the dashboard as simple yet interactive.

3. Suggested technologies for the development: -

- [x] a. Java Spring Boot.
- [x] b. Angular (try to use the latest version).
- [ ] c. d3.js (If a chart is included).
- [x] d. Relational Database (Embedded DB is fine)
